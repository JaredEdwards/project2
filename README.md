# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
Ruby 2.4.0

* technologies
  - this project uses rails, devise, bootstrap and heroku

* approach  
  -  The approach taken was to stick to the erd model and focus on completing the basics of just creating ideas and endorsements. After I had full CRUD functionality with that I decided to add the devise gem to allow users to create and edit their own ideas but not others.

* installation
  - clone the repo
  - bundle install
  - deploy rails servers
  - visit localhost: 3000 and have fun creating your own ideas.
  - NOTE: seed data contains A LOT of seeds so feel free to eliminate some if its too many
